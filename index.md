For this project, Lagrangian particle-based approach has been considered
and hence implemented along with Smooth Particle Hydro Dynamics for
generating fluid simulation. The proceeding section highlights this approach
and how it differs from Eularian approach to solve Navier-Stokes equation of
fluid.
